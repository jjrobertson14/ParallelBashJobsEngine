# HOW TO PERFORM EXAMPLE
- In order to generate input/sample.txt file... 
    - run openssl command in scripts/snippets/create-random-content-file.md
- The parallel bash jobs engine script is scripts/parallelJobEngine.sh
    - run 'bash [path of parallelJobEngine.sh] > output.txt' to start the engine
    - then copy jobs from jobs directory to jobqueue directory
        - (See jobs section in DIRECTORY DESCRIPTIONS section below for explanations of jobs)
            - recommended for example (that utilize sample.txt file you generated with openssl):
                - succeeds_sedSampleOutputCommands.sh
                - failsEchoedCommand_sedSampleOutputCommands.sh
                - failsScript_sedSampleOutputCommands.sh




# HOW TO USE
- run scripts/parallelJobEngine.sh (for example, like `bash scripts/parallelJobEngine.sh > output`)
    - (parallelWithTailDashF.sh may be played around with to help you get a feel for parallel if so desired)
- Then drop job files in jobqueue/ directory
    - Each job file will be ran with a bash process started via parallel 
        - (with up to 2 simultaneous jobs, utilizing 2 cores, at time of writing this, see -j2 flag)
        - (standard output/error of the bash processes is redirected to standard output/error of the parallelJobEngine.sh 
        process)
        - (-d flag sets delimiter between arguments submitted to parallel process to specified character)
        - Any files that fail with error code are moved to the error/ directory (with datetimestamp appended to filename)
    - Then, any lines of output from the running of each job file starting with "_-_-_COMMAND-"...
        - are ran as commands (well, the part of the string after "_-_-_COMMAND-" is)
            - (with up to 6 simultaneous jobs, utilizing 6 cores, at time of writing this, see -j6 flag)
        - standard output of the commands is appended to command-output file
        - standard error of the commands is appended to command-error file
            - additionally, an [ERROR] log message is written to the command-error file
                - (showing the command that failed with error code, job file it is from, and a datetimestamp)
    - Then, all job script files that ran successfully with no error code are moved to archive/ directory
        - (with datetimestamp appended to filename)




# DIRECTORY DESCRIPTIONS
## (committed in git)
##### jobs
- contains example job files that may be dropped in the jobqueue/ directory
- failsEchoedCommand_sedSampleOutputCommands.sh should run succesfully and be moved to archive directory
            - (But if you look in command-error output file, you should see that the command 'cat fakie' failed with an error)
            - (Though if you look at command-output, you should see messages showing that the sed commands ran succesfully)
        - failsScript_sedSampleOutputCommands.sh should fail to run with an error and be moved to error directory
        - succeeds_sedSampleOutputCommands.sh should run successfully and be moved to archive directory
            - (Nothing should be written to command-error, only command-output and output.txt (and maybe test-output file))
##### scripts
- snippets dir contains files containing helpful bash snippets 
- parallelJobEngine.sh is the main job engine script

# (DIRECTORIES GENERATED BY PARALLEL ENGINE SCRIPT)
##### archive
- contains job files that were copied to jobqueue that ran succesfully via the job engine
##### error
- contains job files that were copied to jobqueue that ran unsucessfully via the job engine
##### input
- you may put input files in here 
    - (directory is not used at time of writing this)
##### jobqueue
- job files are to be dropped in here
    - the job engine watches this directory for new scripts, processes them, and moves them to either the archive/ or error/ directory
##### output
- you may have your jobs and job commands output to files within this directory 
    - (directory is not used at time of writing this)

# Output files Description
- command-error
    - contains standard error of job commands that were echoed by job script (lines starting with _-_-_COMMAND- are interpretted as commands)
        - [ERROR] log messages are also written to here
- command-output
    - errors of job commands that were echoed by job script (lines starting with _-_-_COMMAND- are interpretted as commands)
- test-output
    - you may write any test output you want for testing/debugging purposes to this file
    - it is removed once, every time the job engine script is started
